 # Virtual Password Vault Manager

## 📌 Introduction
The **Virtual Password Vault Manager** is a C++ project designed to help users securely store and manage sensitive information like login credentials, credit card details, bank accounts, passports, and driver's licenses. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way to understand secure data handling while exploring key programming concepts in C++.

## 🛠 Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with strong password validation.
- **Data Storage**: Uses linked lists for flexible and dynamic storage.
- **Superblock System**: Supports up to 50 user accounts via structured arrays but can be expanded using vectors for unlimited accounts.
- **Data Management**: Users can add, edit, delete, and search stored records easily.
- **Security Measures**: Includes master password updates and account deletion for enhanced privacy.
- **Activity Logs**: Keeps track of user actions to provide transparency.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **User Registration**: New users create an account with a strong password.
2. **Login & Authentication**: Users log in securely to access stored data.
3. **Data Management**:
   - Store sensitive data in different categories.
   - Modify or delete existing records.
   - Search for specific information.
4. **Superblock Handling**: Tracks user accounts efficiently.
5. **Logs & Security**: Monitors activities and ensures secure data handling.
